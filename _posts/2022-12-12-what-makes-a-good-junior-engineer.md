# What Makes a "Good" Junior Engineer? Perspectives From a Senior

### Introduction

Something I see a lot in DevOps community forums are posts asking how to get into DevOps. This has been answered endlessly and will continue to be with varying degrees of snark depending on the mood of the people replying. Please, [read the friendly manual!](https://roadmap.sh/devops) Something I personally haven't seen nearly as often, despite it being a much more interesting question, is `"How do I succeed as a junior engineer?"`

Most people know and would agree that one's skillset can be broadly delineated into soft skills and technical chops. The interview process is (usually poorly) designed to determine whether the applicant satisfies each of those requirements. So, congrats! You've landed your first job offer. What now?

In my opinion, soft skills are somewhat more important than technical skills to be effective as a junior. They're also significantly more nebulous and harder to distill into something actionable that you can just go study. They require huge amounts of practice to refine, and unlike tech, there's no test environment. Every interaction you have with another person is influencing their perception of you.

I was a junior recently enough that a lot of this is somewhat fresh (and still broadly applicable in subsequent levels), and I mentor juniors regularly at work so I figured I'd write this post up in case anyone else finds it useful.

### Growth Mindset

Get your mind right first, you'll pick up the tech as you go. Hopefully, everyone you work with closely will know that you're novice and set their expectations accordingly. That is a huge blessing as it gives you a ton of room to blatantly not know things. A good junior should be curious, aware of their own limitations, and courageous enough to both try things on their own and ask for help when you need it.

For some strange reason, the initialism `ABL` popped into my head years ago when I was first working at a help desk while studying and I haven't been able to shake it since. It stands for `Always Be Learning` and it is a phrase to live or die by. Technology moves at a rapid pace and must be kept up with over time or you'll get pushed down in the job market. 

- Ask questions when you don't understand something.
- Try to figure things out on your own before asking for help, but don't be stubborn about it. If you've worked a minimum wage job, you'll be shocked by how much you're left alone in a professional setting. Don't misinterpret this as thinking you're expected to work by yourself all the time. Talk to your manager or some seniors on your team about a rule of thumb for how long you should spin your wheels trying to figure something out on your own before asking for help. I would and have been annoyed to find out someone spent 4 hours on something and didn't make any progress when I knew the answer already.
- Seek out constructive feedback and treat it as a gift. It can be easy to get defensive (giving constructive feedback so that it's palatable is an important skill too) but someone just told you how to be better! Thank them, reflect on it, and follow up as needed.
- Learn from your mistakes, but also from your wins. Wisdom comes from self-reflection.
- If you hear words or terms you don't know, look them up or ask what they mean.

### Communication and Politics

Software development is a team sport, and it's imperative to communicate effectively and become well-socialized. As a junior, you won't be trusted to make many decisions on your own. `Hot Take:` Unlike sports, business actually matters, at least to the people working there, usually. People's livelihoods are at stake and it takes a long time to build up the skills and trust required to be allowed to influence decision makers or become one yourself.

Office politics can sometimes be tiresome and has a nasty reputation, but it's also a natural consequence of people working together to influence each other and broader groups. As a junior, it's usually best to avoid politics until you get the lay of the land. Generally speaking, you aren't going to be doing too much in the way of group impact and should instead commit to being an effective follower.

If politics is the consequence of humans working together despite different ideas and priorities, communication is the engine. Below are a few tips on how to communicate effectively and some things to avoid.

- For the love of all that is holy, realize that people are smart and things are often the way they are for reasons that you have no knowledge of. Asking why is great, but reserve judgement on merit until you have a more comprehensive understanding of the thing you might be criticizing.
- Internalize the fact that many of the people you will be working with take a lot of pride in their work. While continuous improvement is an essential part of software development, be careful that you're not calling someone's baby ugly.
- Internalize the fact that as you level up your technical skills, your ability to drive impactful projects and make meaningful achievements is going to be hugely hampered or enabled by your colleague's opinion of you. If you make people feel bad or are difficult to work with then you will be hamstrung in terms of your ability to get other people pulling in the same direction as you.
- While questions are often good, try to get a sense for when your question is specific to you being ignorant or whether it contributes to the discussion. If the former, don't interrupt a meeting to ask it. Ask someone on the side after (or during over chat, if you're comfortable with them).
- Give your full attention when spoken to, people will love you for it. Additionally, listen for understanding, not just to respond. It's obvious when someone is just waiting for their turn to talk. Take a quick note if you have to, or even ask the person to hold their thought for a few seconds so you can give them your full attention without losing your own though.

### Building Trust

Respect should be the default, but trust is largely earned over time and is comprised of what I think of as two main factors: competence and reliability. One without the other does not result in trust, you need both. Here are some things you can do to generate trust, and some other things you can do to destroy it.

* Do not abandon tasks unless priorities have shifted and you've been instructed to pivot. It is very frustrating to have to stay on top of other people's work, especially if you're not their direct supervisor.
* Project management is almost entirely about setting expectations. Communicate early and often to stakeholders on if something is delayed or you hit a roadblock! Being seen as reliable is essential, and you can't accomplish that by surprising people with bad news.
* Make sure you've done your homework before bringing someone else in to help. There are people I work with who always get my attention when they ping me because I've learned to trust that they always raise a good question or topic. Contrary to popular belief, there is in fact such a thing as a bad question. [This site](https://letmegooglethat.com/) exists for a reason.
* As a junior, it is better to freely admit you don't know something than to guess. People will know if you're bullshitting and it will erode their opinion of you. Easier said than done for most people but being self-assured enough of your own intelligence and skills to be comfortable with your own ignorance or misunderstanding is incredibly freeing. One of the smartest people I've met let alone worked with has no qualms about asking for clarification or stating when he's unsure about something.

#### Quick Wins Anyone Can Do

Seriously, if you want to win the hearts and minds of your new team members, document what you're learning as you go and volunteer for the tasks that make other people sigh when they're spoken of. Not only is everything a learning opportunity for you when you're new, other people will remember when you saved them from having to do a task they were dreading even if they had to answer a bunch of questions about it.

- Volunteer for projects, especially things that other people don't want to do. The new pipeline ticket is toil for your senior colleague but represents a learning opportunity for you as well as a chance to deliver business value.
- If you want serious brownie points, document a bunch of tribal knowledge that's missing from the new hire doc they give you. If there isn't a new hire doc, create one and list stuff you had to do to get onboarded. Permissions in this system or that, setting up MFA, whatever.
- Pay attention to things that seem silly. A fresh perspective on systems and processes that your predecessors have been working with for years can be invaluable.

### Learn To Fish (and Self-Advocate)

Even if you don't yet know the word, you must become a devotee of `autodidacticism`

*the process or practice of learning a subject without a teacher or formal education*

*Nota Bene*: I wouldn't recommend you use this word in a professional context except in a self-deprecating way, otherwise the CTO of the small financial firm who reads the first draft of your first professional self-evaluation will mark up the draft after running his comments through a thesaurus and picking each word with the most syllables will make fun of you while simultaneously educating you on the importance of clear, concise language. Please learn from my entirely hypothetical situation, I have to imagine it'd be pretty embarrassing.

But seriously, `ABL` and more specifically, get good at teaching yourself things without needing a live human explaining things to you. And if you've stumped yourself or been spinning your wheels for too long without progress, make sure you're asking for help the right way. If you ever want to get castigated, post a question on Stackoverflow without enough details and see what happens, then realize the people you're asking bad questions at work of are often thinking the same thing, they're just too polite to say it.

- Don't ask for a fish every day, learn to fish! People will generally resent being repeatedly asked to spoonfeed you information that can be looked up in internal docs or the internet. You wouldn't ask your senior colleague the git command to clone a repo. You might ask them if there is any published guidance on whether to use SSH or HTTPS for authentication to the repository.
- Know how to ask for help! Describe what you are trying to do, how are you doing it, why are you trying to achieve by doing it, what went wrong, what did you expected to happen instead and what you have tried to do to make it work as you expected! Be concise on your first few sentences, so that people can judge quickly if they can help you or not, but provide extensive details of your digging to find the root cause.
- Read (and Google) error messages, someone spent a lot of time writing error handling and trying to give you useful information.
- Try to understand, at least at a high level, the software development lifecycle at your company within the first few weeks. A good way to approach this is to pick a repository and map out how code goes from a developer's machine to production. Start with just system to system: `local -> GitHub -> CI -> CD -> Develop -> UAT -> Staging -> Prod` then recursively dig into the actual processes happening in each system until you understand the same regular abstraction layers as your senior colleagues. This will provide a great foundational understanding of things you're likely responsible for and will help get you in the mix sooner.
- Work with your supervisor, or even ask senior colleagues for input on a career development plan. You should orient yourself with the expectations of the next level up and use those to guide your progress.
