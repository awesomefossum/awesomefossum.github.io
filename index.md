Hey folks, I'm Kyle! I've been extremely lucky to have been able to learn and do so much during my career so far and I decided to start this blog as a small way to pay it forward.

The path to becoming a software engineer (especially a DevOps specialist) can be circuitious to say the least, and tortorous at worst. I'm hoping that content here might prove helpful to some folks, even if it's just my 2c about what worked for me or recommendations about learning materials.

When I'm not policing Azure or putting out digital fires, I like to spend my time reading (more so listening these days) to fantasy books, hiking in New England, and spending time with my wife and three cats.
